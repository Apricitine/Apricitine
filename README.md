# 🌑Hiiiii🌕
Hi! I'm Apricitine. I make weird things (quite infrequently) and put them here for the world to see.  
Please don't look at my repos. You'll be disappointed... 😐

## About Me
I'm a KHZlcnkpIHlvdW5n and inexperienced programmer/web developer, as evidenced by my projects. I never finish anything and spend too much time typing `help` in the terminal. 
In case you were wondering (you weren't), here's my experience.

> Java (average)  
> C++ (nooby)  
> Python (learning)
